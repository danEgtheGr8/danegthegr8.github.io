                        <p>We are a family of four - Danny, Emma, Freddie, Charlotte.  We love spending time together and doing things as a family.  We currently reside in Darenth, which is in North-Kent, fairly close to London.</p>
                        <p>We hope you can spend a bit of time on our site and learn a little bit about our family.</p>

                            <p>Danny & Emma are finally tying the knot in April 2023 - we will be updating the site with pictures as we go.</p>
                            <p>Although Danny & Emma have been together for over 14 years, they have known each other for much longer, so this day is very much long-overdue!</p> 
                            <p>Although they had discussed a wedding many times, Emma assumed that they would never get married, and used to joke that she would not marry Danny even if he asked - that was until Danny popped the question in the summer of 2021, and made Emma an offer that she couldn't refuse!</p>

                            <p>Danny & Emma first lived together when they moved to a two bedroom flat in Sidcup, Kent, in 2009.  Freddie came along the following year, and the family of three would spend six years in total here.  They moved to a two bedroom terraced house in Blackfen in 2015, and two years later Charlotte arrived and made our family complete. </p>

                            <p>Four people living in a two bedroom house was challenging, and in the summer of 2019 the family relocated to a four bedroom house in Darenth, where they currently reside.  We love our house, and it means that everyone has plenty of room, especially the children, who both go to school locally.</p>
